# dotfile_minimal
Minimal bashrc vimrc and gitconfig. Just enough to be comfortable on a new machine.
Separating my bigger dotfiles repo for ease of cloning.


# Installation
- Clone the repo
- Run `./bootstrap.sh`
    - it will create .bashrc, .vimrc and .gitconfig if they don't already exist at $HOME
    - it will append instructions to source the corresponding files in this repo to .bashrc, .vimrc and .gitconfig
